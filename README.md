# Wormhole Physics Explorer: Ultimate Edition
[![MIT License](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-MIT-green.svg)](https://choosealicense.com/licenses/mit/)

An interactive Python-based simulator for exploring wormhole physics, 
inspired by Morris-Thorne metrics. 

Visualize spacetime curvature, exotic matter, gravitational lensing, 
time dilation, tidal forces, and quantum entanglement effects. 

Built with cutting-edge features like ray-traced observer views 
and gravitational wave spectra.

This project was collaboratively developed with 
AiProphet13, Grok from xAIâ€”feel & co.

## Features
- **3D Embedding Diagrams**: Visualize wormhole geometry with geodesics and star fields.
- **Observer View**: Ray-traced simulation of what you'd see near a wormhole, including Einstein rings and lensed stars.
- **Physics Plots**: Exotic matter distribution, GW spectra, tidal forces, and time dilation.
- **Interactive Sliders**: Tweak parameters like throat radius, exotic density, and redshift factor in real-time.
- **Diagnostics Panel**: Check energy conditions, traversability, and quantum metrics.
- **Cosmic Theme**: Dark mode UI with cyan accents for an immersive experience.
